Hacks/Hackers aims to bring together journalists and technologies. As such, it is compiling or creating resources to help.

**The [Hacks/Hackers Survival Glossary][1]** is a crowdsourced explanation of terms that help us understand the technologies involved in modern content distribution. Don&#8217;t know Drupal from Django, API from Ajax, mashup from metadata? This is the list for you. It&#8217;s written for intelligent nontechies in (mostly) plain English. Feel free to distribute or contribute. Since being [put up on Poynter Online][2], it has proved so popular that it accounts for several percentage points of traffic every day. The list is currently being translated into French and Arabic.

[**Hacks/Hackers**][3] **is teaming up with** [**Mozilla**][4], the [open-source-oriented][5] nonprofit, to creating a course through [Peer-to-Peer University][6], with the aim of collective eduction: the hackers teaching the journos, and vice versa.  The class will be a six-week commitment, with one hour a week of lectures and one project. It will cover a broad range of topics, and instructors will (tentatively) include NYT interactive guru and Hacks/Hackers honcho [Aron Pilhofer][7], [Amanda Hickman][8] (teaching about mapping), and [David Cohn][9] (instructing students on online collaboration). Nieman Lab [did a write-up][10] when it won a prize at the MIT Future of Civic Media conference.
