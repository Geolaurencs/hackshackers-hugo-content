## Front matter style

In static site generators like Hugo, "front matter" refers to a technique of placing metadata (e.g. title, publish date, etc) before the content of a page.

Hugo supports multiple [front matter formats](https://gohugo.io/content/front-matter/). We prefer **JSON** because it's so common across different systems.
