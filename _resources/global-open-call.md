The global open calls are a regular conference call for Hacks/Hackers organizers and members to share details of current and upcoming events in the community, and to discuss the future of the Hacks/Hackers network.

We’re planning to do these calls on the first Tuesday of every month. The dates are listed on the Google Calendar below. You can use the dates below to add these calls to your own calendar. Call-in details will be provided for each call as we find the best way to do these.

**Call-in information: To be provided. Follow [@HacksHackers][1] for updates.**

**Call agenda & notes: To be provided. Follow [@HacksHackers][1] for updates.**
